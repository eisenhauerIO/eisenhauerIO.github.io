## Academic Appointments

### University of Washington — *Affiliate Associate Professor*  
**Seattle, WA** | **Feb 2025 – Present**

- **Teaching:** Instructing a course on causal data analysis and scientific computing in the Department of Economics, cross-listed with the Computer Science and Statistics departments.

---

### University of Bonn — *Professor of Economics*  
**Bonn, Germany** | **Oct 2019 – June 2022**

- **Research Agenda:** Advanced decision-making under uncertainty through robust computational frameworks. Integrated statistical decision theory, robust optimization, and econometric modeling to develop tools that quantify and navigate uncertainty in dynamic systems. Applications included policy design and investment strategies, emphasizing practical, data-driven solutions to complex real-world problems.

- **Policy Agenda:** Led a multidisciplinary project combining economic, epidemiological, and financial models to quantify uncertainty and enhance decision-making. Supported by the university’s Transdisciplinary Research Area and the Volkswagen Foundation, the initiative advanced robust decision frameworks with real-world policy applications.
